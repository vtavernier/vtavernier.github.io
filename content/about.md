title: About me
---

I am a systems and computer graphics engineer with experience in research, but with many other interests like
open-source software, language theory, electronics and music. I am always learning new skills out of curiosity or as
part of my personal projects, and hope to share those discoveries on here when I have the time to write about them. Stay
tuned!

If you are hiring and reading this, you might be interested in my resume ([french](/cv/cv-fr.pdf),
[english](/cv/cv-en.pdf)). All my contact info is available on the [homepage](/).
