# WIP

This part of the article is a work-in-progress.

## Local and remote repositories, how to work with them

* [Git Cheatsheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html)

## I screwed up, can I get my work back?

* [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/)

## Random tips

* zsh plugins for Git completion

# Conclusion

In this second part, we studied how to maintain a clean history using various more or less automated methods. Aside from
making the history human-readable, we'll see this plays a big role in some advanced uses of Git, such as `git bisect`,
which we'll see in the last part of this series.
