Since the early models&amp;rsquo; releases (Arduino Diecimila in 2007 and Duemilanove in 2009), they have become ubiquitous to the point that &amp;ldquo;an Arduino&amp;rdquo; is often used as a synonym for &amp;ldquo;a microcontroller&amp;rdquo;, and have been used in countless projects by makers around the world.
An Arduino Duemilanove. The first Arduino I actually programmed. Source: Wikipedia What this project actually achieved is simplifying microcontroller programming to the extreme, replacing obscure datasheet diving and reference implementation diagrams dissection with intuitive function calls mostly portable across the entire official product range.</description></item></channel></rss>
