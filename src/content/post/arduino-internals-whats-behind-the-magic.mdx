Arduino is an open-source software and hardware platform tailored for electronics beginners and enthusiasts alike. Since
the early models' releases (Arduino Diecimila in 2007 and Duemilanove in 2009), they have become ubiquitous to the point
that "an Arduino" is often used as a synonym for "a microcontroller", and have been used in countless projects by makers
around the world.

![Arduino Duemilanove 2009b](~/assets/images/post/arduino-internals-whats-behind-the-magic/Arduino_Duemilanove_2009b.jpg "An Arduino Duemilanove. The first Arduino I actually
programmed. Source: [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arduino_Duemilanove_2009b.jpg)")

What this project actually achieved is simplifying microcontroller programming to the extreme, replacing obscure
datasheet diving and reference implementation diagrams dissection with intuitive function calls *mostly* portable across
the entire official product range. The "hello world" of electronics, the blinking LED was simplified from this:

```cpp
// Compile with:       avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega328p -DF_CPU=16000000L
// Create binary with: avr-objcopy -O ihex -R .eeprom a.out a.hex
// Upload with:        avrdude -p atmega328p -c arduino -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 57600 -D -U flash:w:a.hex:i
// Only works on the Arduino Uno series, with a 16MHz µC
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <util/delay.h>

int main() {
  // Set the LED's pin to output
  DDRB |= (1 << PB5);

  while (1) {
    // Toggle the LED pin state
    PORTB ^= (1 << PB5);
    // Wait
    _delay_ms(1000);
  }
}
```

To this:

```cpp
// In the Arduino IDE, click "upload"
// Portable across all Arduinos which have a built-in LED
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
  // Set the LED's pin to output
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Switch on the LED
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  // Wait
  delay(1000);
  // Switch off the LED
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  // Wait
  delay(1000);
}
```

Of course, this is just scratching the surface, since opening up the world of microcontrollers to the masses also
sparked a lot of open-source development, and many libraries can be used to interact with the "shields", add-ons to the
base Arduino board: [motor drivers](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-motor-shield-rev3), [Ethernet
interfaces](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-ethernet-shield-2), [IMUs](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-imu-shield)
and countless others.

Various [starter kits](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Project-Tutorial-Controller-Projects/dp/B01D8KOZF4) can also be
used if you want to prototype your own circuits with an Arduino Uno compatible board and some standard components, such
as an ultrasonic distance reader, humidity and temperature sensor, 7-segment displays, etc.

The USB (data and power!) connection on most boards means these are just plug and play: buy an Arduino board from your
favorite reseller, and you can program it from any desktop or laptop PC.

Recently however, a lot of "Arduino-compatible" boards started appearing on the market, such as the hugely popular
ESP8266 from Espressif Systems, available on the original [NodeMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU), but also in
Arduino-Uno [footprints](https://www.amazon.com/ARCELI-ESP8266-Development-Compatible-Arduino/dp/B07J2QKNHB/), with
built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, much more processing power as well as large storage.

![WeMos D1](~/assets/images/post/arduino-internals-whats-behind-the-magic/WeMos_D1.jpg "WeMos D1, one of the many ESP8266 boards")

Even though those were not initially programmable from the Arduino IDE, the Arduino community added support for these as
they became one of the most go-to choices for IoT projects over the recent years.

But with such a wide variety of hardware, how does the Arduino platform provide an *almost* seamless development
experience on AVR, ARM, Xtensa and many other architectures?

Experienced embedded developers know this means installing various toolchains for cross-compiling, fiddling with linker
scripts to get the right memory layout for your specific board revision, and a bunch of other boring stuff we won't get
to in this article. Instead, we'll be focusing on the software side: what's exactly behind `#include <Arduino.h>` on a
few select platforms, and why we would need to care about it.

# Arduino framework architecture

For most software projects, the go-to way for getting information about library internals would be hitting the reference
manual online. In the case of Arduino, it is located at https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en. However, it is surprisingly
succint: function signatures included in the documentation don't even show the arguments'
type[^arduino-reference-no-signature].

For a beginner, using the C++ language, whose type conversions are a minefield[^cpp-minefield], on a target that doesn't
support debugging (and where buffer overflows result in usually very funny looking output on your serial port monitor)
can lead to many headaches and hours of painful trial and error.

This reference was also written for the *original* Arduino boards, i.e. the AVR-based ones. The most notable example is
the [PROGMEM](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/utilities/progmem/) variable modifier, which is
only available on AVR targets. Trying to use it on non-AVR targets results in a compile-error, unless your code detects
it is being compiled for a non-AVR target.

The reference documentation also mixes [standard library functions](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/#functions),
[plain datatypes and complex ones](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/#variables)[^string-datatype], [Arduino program
structure and C++ language details](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/#structure) on a single page.

**To be absolutely clear:** I am not saying this is a bad thing. This documentation has been written with the clear
intent of being a one-stop point, easy to approach for a beginner, and should be sufficient for hobbyists to get
started, until they are more at ease with electronics and/or software development --- and it accomplishes this goal
rather well. But for more advanced users, it is clearly lacking information about design choices and platform
differences --- a notable issue when promoting Arduino code as platform-independent.

My goal when writing this article was to share with the world the process I went through to unearth some differences I
noticed when working with various boards (ESP8266, Arduino Nano 33 BLE, ATTiny85-based Digispark and others). So let's
get started!

## What's behind `Arduino.h` exactly?

Using a new board in the Arduino IDE is as simple as downloading the right *core* through the *board manager*. We can
look around starting from a basic sketch to peek at the internals of what this *core* really is. Starting with
`Arduino.h`, which all Arduino code should `#include` to access the standard library functions described in the
reference documentation, using an IDE with code completion[^vim-platformio-ccls], we can just ask the editor to open the
header file under our cursor and follow the include graph.

This will bring up this version of `Arduino.h` from the core installation path. When building for an AVR board such as
the Arduino Uno, this will bring up
[$AVR_CORE/cores/arduino/Arduino.h](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/cores/arduino/Arduino.h),
which already teaches us a lot:
* There's all the constants in the documentation, as `#define`s, and some functions which are actually implemented as
  macros (e.g. `min` and `max`).
* Gated behind `__cplusplus`, includes for some types defined by Wiring, the predecessor of the Arduino framework,
  itself based on Processing. The main one being `WString.h`, defining the `String` type.
* Some board-specific stuff, like including USB API support or hardware serial support depending on preprocessor
  definitions.
* A final include for `pins_arduino.h`, which contains mappings from Arduino pin numbers (0-13 as what's passed to
  `digitalWrite`) to physical microcontroller pins (`PORTB`, `PORTC` registers and others). This one is stored in the
  `$AVR_CORE/variants/$VARIANT` folder: depending on the current board, the right `-I` flag will be passed to the
  compiler to include mappings for the target, for example the Arduino Mega (`$VARIANT = mega`), or Uno (`$VARIANT =
  standard`).

Noting the dependencies while following along, we can draw a (partial so it fits in a blog post) include graph between
the different components of this core:

</figure>

This `Arduino.h` is already hardware-specific, even if most of it is hardware-independent. Its definitions follow what
we can see in the reference documentation, but it is definitely **not** portable. It is however shared for all boards
using the same architecture, and maintained by the same entity. In this case, this is the original AVR core, and it is
even available on GitHub, in a sensible location: https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr.

Let's explore it a bit more: the core also contains the actual implementations of functions from the Arduino framework,
which is what we're after. To keep this short, we will look at `digitalWrite`, about which there is already a lot to
say.

### Arduino's `digitalWrite` on Atmel's AVR platform

Using our trusty editor and it is *go to implementation* feature, we can quickly find it in
[wiring_digital.c](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/9f8d27f09f3bbd1da1374b5549a82bda55d45d44/cores/arduino/wiring_digital.c#L138),
in all its microcontroller-programming-simplifying glory:

```cpp
void digitalWrite(uint8_t pin, uint8_t val)
{
	uint8_t timer = digitalPinToTimer(pin);
	uint8_t bit = digitalPinToBitMask(pin);
	uint8_t port = digitalPinToPort(pin);
	volatile uint8_t *out;

	if (port == NOT_A_PIN) return;

	// If the pin that support PWM output, we need to turn it off
	// before doing a digital write.
	if (timer != NOT_ON_TIMER) turnOffPWM(timer);

	out = portOutputRegister(port);

	uint8_t oldSREG = SREG;
	cli();

	if (val == LOW) {
		*out &= ~bit;
	} else {
		*out |= bit;
	}

	SREG = oldSREG;
}
```

To set the logic level of an output pin, `digitalWrite` actually does the following:
* Check that the given pin is suitable for digital output (the `digitalPinTo*` family of functions will return `NOT_*`
  sentinel values otherwise)
* Disable hardware PWM on the target pin if it was enabled
* Disable hardware interrupts, set the target value, and then re-enable them

For a microcontroller running at 16MHz, `digitalWrite` is a noticeably expensive operation. Indeed, it does:
* 3 `PROGMEM` reads (`digitalPinTo*` function calls) for `timer`, `bit` and `port`.
* 2 branches to validate the pin values. Note that the function fails silently for wrong pin values.
* 1 more `PROGMEM` read for getting the port's output register from its port number `port`.<br/>
  > *Note: by this point, all the values in the data flow are returned from reading constant arrays in program memory
  > with `pgm_read_byte`. Even though these values should be constant folded if `pin` and `val` are themselves
  > constants, the compiler can't reason enough yet to perform this optimization. Which means the rest of the operations
  > can't be optimized for constants.*
* Disable interrupts[^critical-section].
* One last branch to determine if a bit should be cleared or set.
* Apply the bitmask: this is a read-modify-write operation, and thus non-atomic, which requires disabled interrupts for
  correctness.
* Restore interrupts.

These multiple levels of indirections are, at the time of writing, **not** optimized away by `avr-gcc`. The following
Arduino sketch (which only uses constants for both the pin and value):

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() { pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); }

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
}
```

Compiles to the following assembly[^arduino-platformio-optimization]:

```asm
000000e0 <digitalWrite.constprop.0>:
  # [truncated: 54 instructions for computing timer, bit, port and other checks]
  #   uint8_t oldSREG = SREG;

  #   }
  #   SREG = oldSREG;
 16e:	9f bf       	out	0x3f, r25	# 63
  # }
 170:	08 95       	ret

00000206 <main>:

 # Note: loop is inlined since it is only called from Arduino's main
 # digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
 2c6:	81 e0       	ldi	r24, 0x01	# 1
 2c8:	0e 94 70 00 	call	0xe0	# 0xe0 <digitalWrite.constprop.0>

 2d4:	c1 f3       	breq	.-16     	# 0x2c6 <main+0xc0>

 # [truncated: more main code]
```

While its equivalent pure-AVR code:

```cpp
#include <avr/io.h>

int main() {
  DDRB |= (1 << PB5);

  while (1) {
    PORTB |= (1 << PB5);
    PORTB &= ~(1 << PB5);
  }
}
```

Compiles to the optimal assembly below (`sbi` sets a specific bit in a port register, and `cbi` clears it):

```asm
00000080 <main>:
  # DDRB |= (1 << PB5);
  80:	25 9a       	sbi	0x04, 5	# 4
  # while (1) {
  # PORTB |= (1 << PB5);
  82:	2d 9a       	sbi	0x05, 5	# 5
  # PORTB &= ~(1 << PB5);
  84:	2d 98       	cbi	0x05, 5	# 5
  # }
  86:	fd cf       	rjmp	.-6      	# 0x82 <main+0x2>
```

Which brings us to the essential question: **is the Arduino framework's implementation right?**

In a sense, **yes**: it translates user-facing Arduino board pin identifiers to hardware pins under the hood, ensures
there are no conflicts with PWM settings, and does update the output register in a correct (atomic) way. **But**, this
is a very costly abstraction (67 instructions + function call compared to one *single-cycle* instruction). If your code
does some high-frequency bit banging (every few clock cycles), you won't be able to use `digitalWrite`, which is orders
of magnitude slower, and has side effects (disabling interrupts temporarily).

Of course, these abstractions are what make Arduino beginner-friendly, but are limited because of their implementation
in C++. A language with more robust compile-time guarantees could reason more efficiently about hardware port usage, and
could also compile to the optimal version --- but [the Rust backend isn't there
yet](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78260).

More details about this assembly comparison are available on [this
page](https://vtavernier.github.io/blog-arduino-internals/). As an extra comparison point, a proof of concept for a
template-based hardware abstraction is included, which compiles to the same optimal assembly as raw AVR code. Please
note that the Arduino version also has timer interrupts for maintaining a clock, which explains most of the program size
difference --- aside from the actual `digitalWrite` calls.

Personally, I think these limitations should *at least* be mentioned in the reference documentation. This wouldn't
overload beginners browsing the function reference for the first time, as long as it is hidden in an expandable "For
advanced users" section. This function <span class="tooltip" title="Does this call for a part 2 🤔?">isn't the only one
with caveats</span>, and it is likely that large projects using the Arduino platform will encounter more of those --
undocumented -- limitations and performance/readability trade-offs.

### Arduino's `analogWrite` on the Mbed framework

Backtracking a bit, we can look at a core's implementation for another platform. In this case, the [ARM Mbed
core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed) for Mbed enabled devices. [Mbed](https://os.mbed.com/) is an
open-source operating system for IoT applications running on the ARM architecture. The goal of this kind of *operating
systems* is to simplify embedded development for the supported platforms, the same way the Arduino framework simplifies
development for the Arduino-enabled boards.

The [Arduino Nano 33 BLE](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble) is one example of such a board. Its nRF52840 SoC
contains a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 CPU running at 64MHz as well as a Bluetooth chip which supports BLE. This is the board
we will be using as a target for looking under the hood.

![Arduino Nano 33 BLE](~/assets/images/post/arduino-internals-whats-behind-the-magic/Arduino_Nano_33_BLE.jpg "Arduino Nano 33 BLE. Source: [arduino.cc](https://arduino.cc)")

The `Arduino.h` header is located in the same directory, relative to the Mbed core root, and corresponds roughly to what
we saw before for the AVR core: generic Arduino definitions and "hardware"-specific. "Hardware" in quotes since the Mbed
framework is already an abstraction layer over the actual processor:

<figure>
<Diagram code={`
graph LR
  sketch[Blink.ino] --> arduino_h

  subgraph arm_mbed[Arm Mbed]
    subgraph mbed_target_nrf5x[nrf5X SDK]

    end

    mbed_h[mbed.h] -.-> nrfx_h
  end

  subgraph mbed_core[Arduino Mbed Core]
    arduino_h[Arduino.h] --> mbed_h
  end
`} />
<figcaption>Arduino Mbed partial include graph</figcaption>
</figure>

In this case, the Arduino core provides:
* An abstraction over the Mbed API, for platform-independence of Arduino code, and to simplify it for beginners
* The hardware pin mappings for the various boards (*variants*), since Mbed is only responsible for interacting with the
  CPU

This can easily be seen by looking at the implementation of, let's say `analogWrite` in
[cores/arduino/wiring_analog.cpp](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed/blob/e50ec8aa1b1cd3079566b66b22bf8ded5e253cbb/cores/arduino/wiring_analog.cpp#L45):

```cpp
static int write_resolution = 8;
// [...]
void analogWrite(PinName pin, int val)
{
  pin_size_t idx = PinNameToIndex(pin);
  if (idx != NOT_A_PIN) {
    analogWrite(idx, val);
  } else {
    mbed::PwmOut* pwm = new mbed::PwmOut(pin);
    pwm->period_ms(2); //500Hz
    float percent = (float)val/(float)(1 << write_resolution);
    pwm->write(percent);
  }
}

void analogWrite(pin_size_t pin, int val)
{
  if (pin >= PINS_COUNT) {
    return;
  }
#ifdef DAC
    if (pin == DAC) {
      analogWriteDAC(digitalPinToPinName(pin), val);
      return;
    }
#endif
  float percent = (float)val/(float)(1 << write_resolution);
  mbed::PwmOut* pwm = digitalPinToPwm(pin);
  if (pwm == NULL) {
    pwm = new mbed::PwmOut(digitalPinToPinName(pin));
    digitalPinToPwm(pin) = pwm;
    pwm->period_ms(2); //500Hz
  }
  pwm->write(percent);
}
// [...]
```

Looking at this implementation:
* The first overload is called if you pass a `PinName` for the pin number, which is an `enum` declared by Mbed's
  abstraction layer. If the pin exists in the Arduino's mapping (`PinNameToIndex`), it is forwarded to the second
  overload. Otherwise, writing the PWM parameters is delegated to an `mbed::PwmOut` which is subsequently leaked.
* The second overload is called when passing a raw pin number, which is what Arduino sketches typically do. Skipping
  over the DAC part, this function sets up a singleton `mbed::PwmOut` for this pin in a global array somewhere whose
  mapping is resolved by the `digitalPinToPwm` macro. This allocation only happens once, the `PwmOut` object being
  reused on a subsequent call to `analogWrite` for the same pin.

This implementation is correct: since invoking the constructor for a `mbed::PwmOut` object actually initializes the PWM
hardware for the given pin[^mbed-pwmout-constructor], this side effect only appears when the first `analogWrite` call is
issued. Being able to change the PWM frequency would be nice, but it is currently not possible on other platforms
either. At least, not through the official Arduino API[^change-pwm-frequency].

However, both the [Mbed documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.9/apis/pwmout.html) **and** the [Arduino
documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/) fail to mention one major
limitation. The Arduino 33 BLE is equipped with a RGB LED connected to pins 22, 23, and 24 for its R, G and B channels
respectively. It's a perfect candidate for PWM to dim the various channels:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {}

void loop() {
  auto now = millis();

  // Set the RGB LED color
  analogWrite(LEDR, (now + 100) % 255);
  analogWrite(LEDG, (now + 200) % 255);
  analogWrite(LEDB, (now + 300) % 255);
}
```

This sketch works perfectly fine, but is rather limited. In an actual project, you might also be controlling other
devices using PWM, which the Arduino Nano 33 BLE is perfectly able to do, since PWM is supported on [all digital
pins](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble), according to its technical specifications. Maybe we could control
some extra pins:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {}

void loop() {
  auto now = millis();

  // Set the RGB LED color
  analogWrite(LEDR, (now + 100) % 255);
  analogWrite(LEDG, (now + 200) % 255);
  analogWrite(LEDB, (now + 300) % 255);

  // Added: a red LED on 11, and a green one on 12?
  analogWrite(11, (now + 400) % 255);
  analogWrite(12, (now + 500) % 255);
}
```

When compiled and uploaded to the board, you don't get five PWM pins but instead a board that disappears from the USB
devices on your computer, blinking its builtin LED in a --- rather ominous the first time --- Morse code SOS pattern.
Before assuming the board burnt-out, I tried the following steps:
* Googling the issue: no significant results at the time to help[^google-sos-blink].
* Re-uploading the previous code after resetting: works.
* Replacing `analogWrite` calls with `mbed::PwmOut` objects: doesn't work.

This rules out hardware issues, as well as the Arduino abstraction layer over Mbed. Off to the Mbed source code we go!
Note that the core downloaded by the board manager or PlatformIO does not contain the Mbed source code. It's a rather
large project, and as such is distributed in a pre-compiled version:

<TerminalOutput>
$ <span style="font-weight:bold">find -name *.a</span>

Thankfully, the Mbed source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os). Following the dependency
chain, we can find the source of our issue:
* `mbed::PwmOut` is declared in
  [drivers/include/drivers/PwmOut.h](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/mbed-os-6.9.0/drivers/include/drivers/PwmOut.h).
  It references `hal/pwmout_api.h` which, as the name indicates, is an Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the `PwmOut`
  API.
* The implementation of `mbed::PwmOut` in
  [drivers/source/PwmOut.cpp](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/mbed-os-6.9.0/drivers/source/PwmOut.cpp)
  confirms this: the class methods call methods from this HAL API in order to change the actual hardware state.
* Looking at
  [hal/include/hal/pwmout_api.h](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/mbed-os-6.9.0/hal/include/hal/pwmout_api.h),
  the comments mention that the target should implement the methods declared in this file in order to provide PWM output
  capabilities to the user.
* The CPU on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE is a Nordic nRF52840. The Mbed source code does indeed contain a target for this
  architecture, in
  [targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/tree/mbed-os-6.9.0/targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x).
* A quick `find targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x -name pwmout_api.*` reveals the PWM HAL implementation for this
  target resides in
  [targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x/TARGET_NRF52/pwmout_api.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/mbed-os-6.9.0/targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x/TARGET_NRF52/pwmout_api.c).
  Bingo!

Skimming through this implementation, the first interesting thing is the `nordic_pwm_init` function:

```cpp
static void nordic_pwm_init(pwmout_t *obj)
{
    MBED_ASSERT(obj);

    /* Default configuration:
     * 1 pin per instance, otherwise they would share base count.
     * 1 MHz clock source to match the 1 us resolution.
     */
    nrfx_pwm_config_t config = {
        .output_pins  = {
            obj->pin,
            NRFX_PWM_PIN_NOT_USED,
            NRFX_PWM_PIN_NOT_USED,
            NRFX_PWM_PIN_NOT_USED,
        },
        .irq_priority = PWM_DEFAULT_CONFIG_IRQ_PRIORITY,
        .base_clock   = NRF_PWM_CLK_1MHz,
        .count_mode   = NRF_PWM_MODE_UP,
        .top_value    = obj->period,
        .load_mode    = NRF_PWM_LOAD_COMMON,
        .step_mode    = NRF_PWM_STEP_AUTO,
    };

    /* Initialize instance with new configuration. */
    ret_code_t result = nrfx_pwm_init(&nordic_nrf5_pwm_instance[obj->instance],
                                      &config,
                                      NULL);

    MBED_ASSERT(result == NRFX_SUCCESS);
}
```

A couple of things worth noting:
* It only uses one pin out of four in what looks like a configuration structure for PWM
  (`nrfx_pwm_config_t.output_pins`).
* Initializing a PWM instance an fail, and is thus checked by the `MBED_ASSERT` macro. This macro is used multiple times
  through this implementation. Would this assertion failing trigger the blinking SOS behavior we have encountered?

Finding out the behavior of this macro is left as an exercise to the reader. But since you are still reading this, you
probably quickly found out that a failed assertion leads to an eventual call to
[mbed_die](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/c73413893fb98aaaeda74513c981ac68adc8645d/platform/source/mbed_board.c#L26)
which blinks `LED1` in an SOS pattern indefinitely. Our hypothesis is confirmed!

If you somehow managed to follow this source-digging carefully, you might have noticed `nordic_pwm_init` is a `static`
function: it is only a helper function for implementing the HAL, which is later defined in the file. Namely,
[pwmout_init](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/mbed-os-6.9.0/targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x/TARGET_NRF52/pwmout_api.c#L137):

```cpp
void pwmout_init(pwmout_t *obj, PinName pin)
{
    DEBUG_PRINTF("pwmout_init: %d\r\n", pin);

    MBED_ASSERT(obj);

    /* Get hardware instance from pinmap. */
    int instance = pin_instance_pwm(pin);

    MBED_ASSERT(instance < (int)(sizeof(nordic_nrf5_pwm_instance) / sizeof(nrfx_pwm_t)));

    /* Populate PWM object with default values. */
    obj->instance = instance;
    obj->pin = pin;
    obj->pulse = 0;
    obj->period = MAX_PWM_COUNTERTOP;
    obj->percent = 0;
    obj->sequence.values.p_common = &obj->pulse;
    obj->sequence.length = NRF_PWM_VALUES_LENGTH(obj->pulse);
    obj->sequence.repeats = 0;
    obj->sequence.end_delay = 0;

    /* Set active low logic. */
    obj->pulse |= SEQ_POLARITY_BIT;

    /* Initialize PWM instance. */
    nordic_pwm_init(obj);
}
```

Interestingly enough, this code is very similar to the Arduino implementation of `analogWrite`. The pin number is mapped
to an *instance* number:

```cpp
    /* Get hardware instance from pinmap. */
    int instance = pin_instance_pwm(pin);
```

[pin_instance_pwm](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/c73413893fb98aaaeda74513c981ac68adc8645d/targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x/TARGET_NRF52/pinmap_ex.c#L307)
actually allocates hardware PWM instance numbers for the given pin. If no more instances are available, it will return
the `NC` constant to indicate no such instance is available:

```cpp
/**
 * Brief       Find hardware instance for the provided PWM pin.
 *
 *             The function will search the PeripheralPin map for a pre-allocated
 *             assignment. If none is found the allocation map will be searched
 *             to see if the same pins have been assigned an instance before.
 *
 *             If no assignement is found and there is an empty slot left in the
 *             map, the pins are stored in the map and the hardware instance is
 *             returned.
 *
 *             If no free instances are available, the default instance is returned.
 *
 * Parameter   pwm   pwm pin.
 *
 * Return      Hardware instance associated with provided pins.
 */
int pin_instance_pwm(PinName pwm)
```

Thus, how many instances are there? [**four**, according to the declaration preceding
`pin_instance_pwm`](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/c73413893fb98aaaeda74513c981ac68adc8645d/targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x/TARGET_NRF52/pinmap_ex.c#L281).
This means that when `pwmout_init` runs out of hardware PWM instances, the [following
assertion](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/c73413893fb98aaaeda74513c981ac68adc8645d/targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x/TARGET_NRF52/pwmout_api.c#L146)
will fail:

```cpp
    MBED_ASSERT(instance < (int)(sizeof(nordic_nrf5_pwm_instance) / sizeof(nrfx_pwm_t)));
```

Which in turn, stops the CPU and blinks the builtin LED in an SOS pattern. **Mystery solved! 🎉**

> But **hold on**. Why say PWM output is supported on all digital pins if we can only use four of them at the same time?

Well, according to the [product
specification](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fstruct_nrf52%2Fstruct%2Fnrf52840.html), the nRF52840
does feature *4x four channel pulse width modulator (PWM) unit with EasyDMA*. What this actually means is that there are
four fully-independent PWM modules (the *hardware instances* in the code we just studied), each of which can drive four
pins. This brings the total of PWM pins to 16, which is much more reasonable as long as you can group them into the four
PWM modules available.

If you spend more time digging through the [Nordic SDK documentation for
PWM](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.0.0%2Fgroup__nrf__pwm.html&cp=7_5_3_6_9_0_12),
you will find out that the 4 pins of a single instance will share the same PWM frequency, but you can still set
different duty cycles. ARMed with this knowledge, you may now implement an nRF-specific PWM port that can drive 4 pins
at the same time, but only using one hardware instance. See my implementation which resulted from this
reverse-engineering at
[nrf_pwm_port.hpp](https://github.com/vtavernier/smart-tps/blob/master/include/nano33ble/nrf_pwm_port.hpp) and
[nrf_pwm_port.cpp](https://github.com/vtavernier/smart-tps/blob/master/src/nano33ble/nrf_pwm_port.cpp).

This leaves us with a fully-dimmable RGB LED and 3 possible `analogWrite`-controllable pins. **Problem solved!**

# Conclusion

I wanted to share this reverse-engineering adventure as I think it could be useful for other developers working with the
Arduino ecosystem. Most of the discoveries mentioned here are to my knowledge, at the time of writing this article, not
documented anywhere.

To me, even with those hidden caveats, Arduinos are still an excellent platform for beginners and hobbyists. These
limitations should not be encountered in *most* cases, and more experienced developers should be able to work around
these issues by reaching for the hardware SDKs directly.

The only major pain point I had working with Arduino libraries is the strong coupling with the hardware. If you wish to
test some of your code on your computer instead of the target board (PlatformIO has a `native` target just for this),
you have to design your code around the fact that `Arduino.h` is not available for desktop targets, even if most of it
is hardware-independent. But we shall go down this rabbit hole another time.

Until then, happy hacking!

[^arduino-reference-no-signature]: See "Syntax" and "Parameters" in
  https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/
[^cpp-minefield]: Using this [digest version](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion) of the C++
  standard for implicit conversions, try predicting what passing an `int` to a function that expects a `byte`
  (Arduino-specific definition). Bonus points if you can describe what happens on overflow on the various architectures
  this code could be run on.
[^string-datatype]: `int`, `char`, `float` and other built-in data-types are C++ built-ins, supported directly by the
  target platform and are basically free to create. This isn't the case of the `String` type, which allocates memory, an
  expensive and error-prone operation (running out of heap space overwrites your program's stack --- a "technicality"
  not mentioned in the documentation).
[^vim-platformio-ccls]: Creating a project with `pio init --ide vim` will create the necessary files for the `ccls`
  language server to provide completion and go-to definition for Arduino code. This what I mainly used for this work.
[^critical-section]: On AVR, setting a bit in an output register is an atomic operation (`sbi` instruction). However,
  `*port |= mask` is a *read-modify-write* operation since `mask` may set more than one bit and/or not be a constant. By
  being 3 instructions long, there is a chance an interruption could happen between the *read* and *write*, and break
  the code. Thus, a critical section is required, which equates to temporarily disabling interrupt handling.
[^arduino-platformio-optimization]: PlatformIO uses `-flto -Os` as the default optimization level, but changing those
  settings didn't influence the result significantly.
[^mbed-pwmout-constructor]: The [official documentation for
  `mbed::PwmOut`](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.9/mbed-os-api-doxy/classmbed_1_1_pwm_out.html#ae90809b159b1af641a257b3505c56c41)
  does not mention it, but looking through the [source
  code](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/c73413893fb98aaaeda74513c981ac68adc8645d/drivers/source/PwmOut.cpp#L162)
  you can find that `PwmOut::init` invokes `pwmout_init` from the hardware abstraction layer, which does indeed
  initialize the PWM hardware.
[^change-pwm-frequency]: If you pick the right PWM pins on an AVR board, you can access the registers directly and set
  the PWM frequency, as described on the [Arduino
  Wiki](https://www.arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Tutorial/SecretsOfArduinoPWM). On an Mbed board, you can just use the
  `mbed::PwmOut` class directly.
[^google-sos-blink]: Google's indexing of pages changes all the time, and today you might find out [this forum
  post](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/arduino-nano-33-ble-damaged/639669/2), where the first answer mentions that's what
  Mbed does when it crashes, which could be for various reasons. This answer also includes a vague reference to the
  issue we're encountering here.
