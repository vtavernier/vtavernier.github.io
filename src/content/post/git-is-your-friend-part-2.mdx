We ended the previous part of this tutorial on merging local changes with remote changes. That last part assumed there
was no merge conflict --- a situation you may have already encountered in the wild. We will now look at how to solve
those conflicts efficiently, which becomes critical for the next part, maintaining a clean Git history using interactive
rebasing.

# Solving merge conflicts with a merge tool

Let us start with the following situation:

```txt
    C origin/master
   /
  A---B master
```

We can visualize this in our terminal:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git log --all --oneline --graph</span>
* <span style="color:olive;">d105f20</span><span style="color:olive;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">origin/master</span><span style="color:olive;">)</span> Add success return to main
<span style="color:red;">|</span> * <span style="color:olive;">836ba41</span><span style="color:olive;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">HEAD -&gt; </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">master</span><span style="color:olive;">)</span> Add error return to main
<span style="color:red;">|</span><span style="color:red;">/</span>  
* <span style="color:olive;">a5aea3c</span> Initial commit
`} />

If, from the `master` branch we try to use `git pull` (effectively running `git merge origin/master`), we will end up
with the following warning from Git: <a id="conflicted-state-1"></a>

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git pull</span>
From .
 * branch            origin/master -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging main.c
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in main.c
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
`} />

This means --- exactly as mentioned by the Git output --- that there is no way to automatically merge changes from the
two branches being merged. Indeed, if we look at the `master` branch, this is our (local) change:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white">git show master --oneline</span>
<span style="color:olive;">836ba41cac2a63cb2e060dfb5fdc9c6bdea82882</span> Add error return to main
<span style="font-weight:bold;">diff --git a/main.c b/main.c</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">index 0a502e4..dd314f9 100644</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">--- a/main.c</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">+++ b/main.c</span>
<span style="color:teal;">@@ -2,4 +2,5 @@</span>
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 
 int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
<span style="color:green;">+</span>	<span style="color:green;">return 1;</span>
 }
`} />

While the `origin/master` had those (remote) --- incompatible --- changes:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white">git show origin/master --oneline</span>
<span style="color:olive;">d105f20e3f19cdc2786d374e73f9f4cd8aa560ec</span> Add success return to main
<span style="font-weight:bold;">diff --git a/main.c b/main.c</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">index 0a502e4..296c7ac 100644</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">--- a/main.c</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">+++ b/main.c</span>
<span style="color:teal;">@@ -2,4 +2,5 @@</span>
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 
 int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
<span style="color:green;">+</span>	<span style="color:green;">return 0;</span>
 }
`} />

How do we fix those changes?

## The manual (bad) way

Upon discovering the `fix conflicts and then commit the result` message from Git, the inexperienced Git user might do
exactly as suggested. They would open the files in conflict one-by-one in their editor, and be greeted with this
interesting syntax:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
	return 1;
=======
	return 0;
>>>>>>> d105f20e3f19cdc2786d374e73f9f4cd8aa560ec
}
```

The `<<<`, `===` and `>>>` character sequences are called *conflict markers*, since they mark a region of the file as in
conflict. The name following `<<<` is the local revision name (`HEAD` since we are merging into the current branch), and
similarly the name following `>>>` is the remote revision name (here denoted by its commit SHA).

The first region between `<<<` and `===` contains the changes brought by the local revisions, and the second region
between `===` and `>>>` the changes from the remote revisions. To solve the merge conflict, we need to pick which region
needs to be merged in.

The *manual* way to do it is to remove the conflict markers, and the region we do not want to keep in the resulting
file. After closing the editor, running `git status` informs us of the current state of the repository:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to merge the remote branch into yours)

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run &quot;git commit&quot;)
  (use &quot;git merge --abort&quot; to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to mark resolution)
	<span style="color:red;">both modified:   main.c</span>

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
`} />

Indeed, writing to a file does not inform Git that the conflict has been resolved. You need to mark the conflict as
resolved with `git add main.c` (since `main.c` is the file that we resolved conflicts in) before finishing the merge
with `git commit`:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git add main.c</span>
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git commit --no-edit</span> <span style="color:gray"># --no-edit skips opening the editor</span>
[master 8738275] Merge branch 'origin/master'
`} />

***Make sure you solved all the conflicts***: if you call `git add` on a file which still has conflict markers, there
will be no warnings and you will commit corrupted files to your repository. Nothing that can't be fixed, but this is
hard to fix for future maintainers. Especially if you don't have continuous integration set up to catch those mistakes
early...

Since this process has multiple points of failure, we should try to find a *better* method, which does not have this
many pitfalls. Thankfully, Git has us covered.

## The automated (good) way

In order to automate the conflict resolution process, Git supports so-called *merge tools*: programs that will be run by
Git in order to help the user fix conflicts by picking the right options on every conflicted region. First, we need to
configure a *merge tool*. We will use the graphical tool [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/), although many others are
available[^other-merge-tools].

First, install Meld using your distribution's package manager:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
$ sudo apt install meld
# Fedora
$ sudo dnf install meld
```

Then, we need to indicate to Git we want to use Meld as our merge tool:
```bash
$ git config --global merge.tool meld
```

We are now ready to go! Let's go back to the [conflicted state](#conflicted-state-1). Then, instead of fixing the
conflicts manually, we run the following command:
```bash
$ git mergetool
```

The main window of Meld opens:

![Meld initial window](meld-initial-conflict.png)

As indicated in the headers of the panels:
* The left panel represents the state of the file after local changes: this is our `master` branch we are merging into
* The middle panel is the current state of the file we are building (where conflicts are solved).
* The right panel represents the state of the file after remote changes: this is the `origin/master` branch we are
merging into the `master` branch.

Clicking on the arrows between the left (resp. right) panel will bring in the changes from the local (resp. remote)
branches:

![Meld window after conflict resolution](meld-resolved-conflicts.png)

You can then save the changes with the `Menu > Save all` option, or with `Ctrl+s`. When you have solved the conflict,
you can quit Meld and check the status of our repository:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git status</span>
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to merge the remote branch into yours)

All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use &quot;git commit&quot; to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:
	<span style="color:green;">modified:   main.c</span>

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
	<span style="color:red;">main.c.orig</span>
`} />

Two things are worth noting here:
* The `main.c` file was automatically added as all the conflicts were resolved using Meld, so we don't have to call `git
add main.c` (that's one step saved!)
* `main.c.orig` was created: this is a backup copy of `main.c` before the conflict resolution happened. We can remove
it once we're sure the merge completed successfully.

We may then complete our merge process by running `git commit`.

## Merge tools: conclusion

Using a merge tool streamlines the merge conflict resolution process by ensuring we do not miss a step --- and also
saves us a lot of typing and manually editing files. Since you will encounter merge conflicts regularly while using Git
and collaborating with other people, it's a good idea to properly set up your *merge tool* so you don't feel like
smashing your keyboard on merge conflicts.

More complicated merge conflicts might be hard to resolve though, especially when working with someone else's changes.
This is why having a clean Git history is critical, so you can look at it when resolving a merge conflict and make
informed decisions. Thankfully, Git also has us covered.

# Rewriting local history with `git rebase`

We already encountered rebasing in this tutorial: the `git pull --rebase` commands *rebases* (changes the parent of) a
set of commits onto the current state of the remote branch in order to be able to push. However, we can rebase any set
of commits while working locally, not just in the case of a pull.

Let's consider the following situation, with two branches `feature` and `master`:

```txt
        A---B---C feature
       /
  D---E---F---G master
```

Running `git rebase master feature` will *rebase* the `feature` branch onto the `master` branch, resulting in this
state:

```txt
                A'---B'---C' feature
               /
  D---E---F---G master
```

Since Git has to rewrite every commit in the range being rebased, we also have the option to change the contents being
committed at each step. This is what the `-i` option of Git rebase allows us to do: enter *interactive rebasing*.

## Interactive rebasing

When rebasing, you specify which commit (by its SHA, branch name, tag name, etc.) should be the last kept intact. All
the following commits up to `HEAD` (the latest commit on the current branch) will be rebased --- or `--root` to rebase
all the way to the beginning of your repository's history.

After running `git rebase -i --root` on this article's tutorial, Git opens the configured text editor on the *todo
file* below:

```ini
pick a5aea3c Initial commit
pick 836ba41 Add error return to main
pick d105f20 Add success return to main

# Rebase 1813570 onto 0625853 (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
```

Lines starting with `#` are comments to help use edit the *todo file* to describe the operations we want to apply to the
commits about to be rebased. The first lines are commands:
* First column: name of the command to apply
* Second column: either a commit name for `pick`, `reword`, `edit`, `squash`, `fixup`, `drop`; or other command
  arguments for `exec`, `label`, `reset`

The description for these commands is pretty self-explanatory: each command is applied in order from top to bottom to
the commits referenced in the command arguments. If a command fails, Git will stop the rebase process so you can fix the
issue. Let's look at some changes we can make to this history.

### Squashing commits

If for some reason you think two commits should be merged into one instead of being separated, you can use the squash
command. Edit the *todo file* to squash the third commit into the second:

```ini
pick a5aea3c Initial commit
pick 836ba41 Add error return to main
squash d105f20 Add success return to main
```

Then, save the file and exit the editor to run rebasing:

```txt
Auto-merging main.c
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in main.c
error: could not apply d105f20... Add success return to main
Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
"git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
Could not apply d105f20... Add success return to main
```

Uh-oh. There is a merge conflict while rebasing (the same merge conflict we studied earlier in this article). This can
happen when rebasing since some changes may not be compatible and thus require user action. We can solve the issue `git
mergetool` and carry on with the rebase process:

```bash
# Fix issues with your mergetool
$ git mergetool

# Continue rebasing
$ git rebase --continue
```

Squashing commits brings up the editor again to write an appropriate commit message[^fixup-instead-of-squash]:

```ini
# This is a combination of 2 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

Add error return to main

# This is the commit message #2:

Add success return to main

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Tue Dec 22 21:41:43 2020 +0100
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto bf1a9ac
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    pick 836ba41 Add error return to main
#    squash d105f20 Add success return to main
# No commands remaining.
# You are currently rebasing branch 'master' on 'bf1a9ac'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   main.c
#
```

When you're done editing your commit message, exit your editor and observe the completed result:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git log --oneline</span>
<span style="color:olive;">31c5062</span><span style="color:olive;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">HEAD -&gt; </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">master</span><span style="color:olive;">)</span> Add return to main
<span style="color:olive;">a5aea3c</span> Initial commit
`} />

With our properly written history, we can keep on working on our project.

### Editing commits

Another option when rebasing is *editing* commits. This allows you to change the contents of a commit arbitrarily, by
adding or removing changes, or changing the commit message[^use-reword-instead]. Let's edit commit `31c5062` in the following
history:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git log --oneline</span>
<span style="color:olive;">b9d4427</span><span style="color:olive;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">HEAD -&gt; </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">master</span><span style="color:olive;">)</span> Add computation
<span style="color:olive;">31c5062</span> Add return to main
<span style="color:olive;">a5aea3c</span><span style="color:olive;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">origin/master</span><span style="color:olive;">)</span> Initial commit
`} />

Running `git rebase -i origin/master`, switching the command for `31c5062` to `edit`, saving and quitting the editor
will drop us back to the terminal. Again, Git indicates what the next steps are:

```txt
Stopped at 31c5062...  Add return to main
You can amend the commit now, with

  git commit --amend

Once you are satisfied with your changes, run

  git rebase --continue
```

I decided to add some comments to `main.c` as an example change. We can then continue with the rebasing process:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
<span style="color:gray"># Modify the current commit with the changes made to main.c, skip opening the editor</span>
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git commit --no-edit --amend main.c</span>
[detached HEAD ffd5f65] Add return to main
 Date: Tue Dec 22 21:41:43 2020 +0100
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

<span style="color:gray"># Continue the rebasing process</span>
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git rebase --continue</span>
[detached HEAD 6c65969] Add computation
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/master.
`} />

We're done with our changes!

### Automating rebasing: `git commit --fixup`

Fixing a previous commit with rebasing is such a common occurrence that there are commands dedicated to handling this
case. First, we need to change our `~/.gitconfig` a bit to make it easier to work with:

```ini
# This may equivalently be changed with `git config --global rebase.autosquash true`
[rebase]
	autosquash = true
```

The workflow for `git commit --fixup` is as follows:
1. Change the working copy as needed, and stage the changes with `git add`
2. Identify the commit you want to fix with `git log`. Let's say we want to fix commit `ffd5f65`[^commit-ish] in our example.
3. Run `git commit --fixup ffd5f65`. Note that no message is needed: a placeholder mentioning this is a fix-up is
   generated, and will be discarded by the next step:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white">git commit --fixup ffd5f65</span>
[master cac3701] fixup! Add return to main
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
`} />

4. Run `git rebase -i`. This starts an interactive rebase onto the last pushed state of the current branch. This means
   it shouldn't contain commits that were already shared with other collaborators. As you will notice, the fixup commit
   has been moved to the right location in the *TODO* file, and its action changed to `fixup` (due to the `.gitconfig`
   change we made earlier):
   ```ini
   pick ffd5f65 Add return to main
   fixup cac3701 fixup! Add return to main # <--- Our `git commit --fixup`
   pick 6c65969 Add computation

   # ...
   ```
5. Exit the editor for the *TODO* file. Rebasing procede as we described earlier in this article, stopping if your
   changes were to trigger merge conflicts.

Using `git commit --fixup` results in a more streamlined workflow, as you can just commit fixes to previous commits
without interruption (i.e. you don't have to clean your repository until you actually start the rebasing). Then, when
you are preparing to push your work to the remote, run `git rebase -i` once and all the changes to the history will be
properly integrated!

## Bonus round: making your shell smarter

Editing the history of a Git repository often requires looking up previous commit identifiers, which can quickly become
tedious. Thankfully, modern shells support completion plugins tailored for Git, and by understanding which commands you
are about to run, are able to suggest appropriate completions, such as references and commit SHAs. For example, here's
[Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)'s Git plugin at work, completing a `git commit --fixup` command
(`<TAB>` will cycle through all the options in this menu):

![Prezto Git completion](zprezto-git-completion.png)

These tools are huge time savers, so I highly recommend spending the time setting one up for your shell of choice:
* [Bash, from the official Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash)
* [Zsh, Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto). Enable the `git` plugin in `zpreztorc`.
* [Zsh, oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). Also look for the `git` plugin.

Git GUIs can also help with those features, as well as editor plugins for your editor of choice.

# Final warning: do not rebase pushed commits

I mentioned this multiple times, it is also mentioned in the Git manual pages, but ***do not rebase pushed commits***.
As rebasing changes the commit data, this effectively creates a fork in the history. Since this fork will prevent
fast-forwarding the remote branch label when running `git push`, you will have to run `git push --force[-with-lease]`.
This might:
* Destroy work pushed on the remote server (unless using `--force-with-lease` and making sure you didn't discard it
  while editing the history).
* Make others destroy their own work, when they'll be force to run `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master` to
  reset their local copies to the new history you rebased (discarding the local state of the branch).

So, unless you published secrets in your Git repository, ***do not*** rebase public history to change it.

# Conclusion

In this second part, we studied how to maintain a clean history using various more or less automated methods. Aside from
making the history human-readable, we'll see this plays a big role in some advanced uses of Git, such as `git bisect`,
and how to fix our history-editing mistakes using the *reflog*; which we'll see in the last part of this series.

[^other-merge-tools]: Aside from dedicated merge tools, most editors also support merge conflict resolution, either
  built-in or through plugins. Look online for instructions on how to set them up, for example for
  [Vim/Neovim](https://www.grzegorowski.com/using-vim-or-neovim-nvim-as-a-git-mergetool) and
  [Emacs](http://blog.binchen.org/posts/emacs-is-the-best-merge-tool-for-git.html).

[^fixup-instead-of-squash]: If you want to keep the first commit message and save yourself one step, you can use the
  `fixup` command, which does specifically that: squash commits, and keep the first message.

[^use-reword-instead]: If you just want to change the message of a given commit, use the `reword` command to save you a
  few steps: this will drop you directly in an editor to change the message instead of having to use `git commit
  --amend`.

[^commit-ish]: You may also use symbolic references (HEAD, branch names) or ancestry references such as `HEAD^` (the
  first parent of `HEAD`), or `HEAD~2` (the first parent of the first parent of `HEAD`). See
  https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection for more details.
