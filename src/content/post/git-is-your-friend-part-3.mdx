# Finding bugs with Git: problem statement

You are working on a large-ish project which is --- thankfully --- under version control. This could be a project with a
large amount of code, with many contributors and thus a lot of activity, or maybe some software you are using that you
decided to contribute to by fixing some bugs. What we will learn today applies to all those cases where you just can't
manually review every single line of code searching for bugs.

Although in the case of this article, we will study a very stripped down example to just learn the essentials of one of
Git's most advanced features: *bisection*. Our example will be a library implementing some sorting algorithms as they
are described on their respective [Wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm).

While developing this library, we shall follow good software development practices, especially ensuring our library has
proper automated testing. Here is the [initial
scaffolding](https://github.com/vtavernier/blog-git-libsort/tree/r-initial) for our library:

* The following functions will be provided by our library:
```cpp
#ifndef _SORT_H_
#define _SORT_H_

#include <cstddef>

typedef int sort_data_t;

void sort_insertion(sort_data_t *data, size_t length);
void sort_selection(sort_data_t *data, size_t length);
void sort_merge(sort_data_t *data, size_t length);
void sort_heap(sort_data_t *data, size_t length);
void sort_quick(sort_data_t *data, size_t length);

#endif /* _SORT_H_ */
```
* They will be tested using a test executable that returns 0 on success, and non-zero on failure:
```cpp
#include "sort.h"

// [...]

int main() {
    int res = 0;
    const size_t Ns[] = {10};

    for (auto &N : Ns) {
        std::vector<sort_data_t> source_vector(N, 0), working_vector(N, 0), sorted_vector(N, 0);

        // Generate some test data
        std::generate(source_vector.begin(), source_vector.end(), [=]() { return rand() % (2 * N); });

        // Generate reference data
        std::copy(source_vector.begin(), source_vector.end(), sorted_vector.begin());
        std::sort(sorted_vector.begin(), sorted_vector.end());

        // Test the insertion sort function
        res += test_sort_function(working_vector, source_vector, sorted_vector, sort_insertion);
        // [...]
    }

    return res;
}
```
* Testing the library is done through a special Makefile rule, so we can just run `make test`:
```make
# [...]

test: $(BUILDDIR)/main
	@echo $(BUILDDIR)/main
	@$(BUILDDIR)/main ; \
	RET=$$? ; \
	if [ $$RET -eq 0 ]; then \
		echo -e "\e[0;32mTests succeeded\e[0m" ; \
	else \
		echo -e "\e[0;31mTests failed with $$RET\e[0m" ; \
		exit $$RET ; \
	fi

# [...]
```

We obtain this output when testing our initial version:
<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">make test</span>
<span style="color:gray;"># Output omitted</span>
build/main
<span style="color:green;">Tests succeeded</span>
`} />

With this perfect development setup in place, we can iteratively improve our library:
<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git log --oneline</span>
<span style="color:olive;">a4ecb0d</span><span style="color:olive;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:teal;">HEAD -&gt; </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:green;">master</span><span style="color:olive;">, </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">origin/master</span><span style="color:olive;">)</span> Update ColumnLimit
<span style="color:olive;">4096d3d</span> Add N=20000 test

`} />

Satisfied with our changes, we check that tests still pass and...

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">make test</span>
<span style="color:gray;"># Output omitted</span>
sort_insertion: error at index 0
sort_insertion: error at index 0

sort_insertion: error at index 0
sort_insertion: error at index 0
<span style="color:red;">Tests failed with 5</span>
make: *** [Makefile:14 : test] Erreur 5
`} />

Where did we go wrong? Let's answer this question using Git.

# Finding trivial bugs with `git blame` and `git log`

Our test harness revealed the `sort_insertion` function is broken. Thus, we might want to look into who changed the
corresponding `src/insertion.cpp` file. The `git log --oneline -- src/insertion.cpp` shows us the history of that file
(commits that do not change this file are omitted):

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git log --oneline -- src/insertion.cpp</span>
<span style="color:olive;">01770f7</span> Change IndentWidth to 4
<span style="color:olive;">5889f58</span> Update sorting logic
<span style="color:olive;">65defb0</span><span style="color:olive;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:olive;">tag: r-initial</span><span style="color:olive;">)</span> Initial commit
`} />

Only 3 commits (out of the 9 commits in our repository) changed that file. This greatly narrows our search space, which
we can further refine using `git blame`. This command outputs which commit changed each line in a given file:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git blame src/insertion.cpp</span>
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  1) #include &quot;sort.h&quot;
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  2)

^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  4) 
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  5) void sort_insertion(sort_data_t *data, size_t length) {
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100  6)     size_t i = 1;
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  7) 
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100  8)     while (i &lt; length) {
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100  9)         size_t j = i;
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100 10)         while (j &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; data[j - 1] &lt; data[j]) {
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100 11)             std::swap(data[j], data[j - 1]);
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100 12)             j--;
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100 13)         }
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100 14)         i++;
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100 15)     }
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100 16) }
`} />

If we cross-reference this with the output of `git log` we notice that most of the file was changed by one single
commit... Which is just formatting changes, and is probably not the culprit (`01770f7a Change IndentWidth to 4`). If we
know this commit indeed doesn't change anything, we can ask Git to ignore it in the blame:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git blame --ignore-rev 01770f7 src/insertion.cpp</span>
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  1) #include &quot;sort.h&quot;
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  2) 
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  3) #include &lt;utility&gt;
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  4) 
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  5) void sort_insertion(sort_data_t *data, size_t length) {
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  6)     size_t i = 1;
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  7) 
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  8)     while (i &lt; length) {
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100  9)         size_t j = i;
<span style="font-weight:bold">5889f58f (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:17:12 +0100 10)         while (j &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; data[j - 1] &lt; data[j]) {</span>
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100 11)             std::swap(data[j], data[j - 1]);
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100 12)             j--;
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100 13)         }
01770f7a (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:18:38 +0100 14)         i++;
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100 15)     }
^65defb0 (Vincent Tavernier 2021-01-24 03:15:15 +0100 16) }
`} />

From this output, we can deduce:
* Most of the code comes from the initial commit, `65defb0`. We know this passed the tests before.
* One line of our sorting logic was changed by commit `5889f58f`. We can show this change in more detail:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`

       std::swap(data[j], data[j - 1]);
       j--;
     }
`} />

This change seems dubious. To confirm this indeed broke our library, we need to test the code before *and* after this
change was introduced. As we are using Git, this is easy to do:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
<span style="color:gray"># Before the changes, check that the tests do pass</span>
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git checkout 5889f58f^ && make test</span>
HEAD is now at 25a6e64 Add N=10000 test
<span style="color:gray;"># Output omitted</span>
build/main
<span style="color:green;">Tests succeeded</span>

<span style="color:gray"># After the changes, check that the tests do not pass</span>
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white;">git checkout 5889f58f && make test</span>
HEAD is now at 5889f58 Update sorting logic
<span style="color:gray;"># Output omitted</span>
build/main
<span style="color:red;">Tests failed with 4</span>
make: *** [Makefile:14: test] Error 4
`} />

Thus, we confirmed commit `5889f58` broke the library!

However, to come to that conclusion we needed to:
* Find which file was the source of the bug (sometimes it could be multiple files, or this could be non-trivial)
* Identify commits bringing relevant changes to the file in question (there could be a lot of irrelevant commits)
* Among relevant commits, find the first one that breaks the build (a lot of commits may have to be checked for that)

This is where the `git bisect` command comes in: a faster, automated way to find bugs.

# Finding any kind of bug with `git bisect`

`git bisect` works under the assumption that:
* You have a *last known good* commit, referred to as **good**, where the bug was not present
* You have a *known bad* commit, referred to as **bad**, following the *good* commit, and where the bug is present

Under this assumption, Git is able to deduce which is the first bad commit in $O(\log_2 N)$ steps, where $N$ is the
number of commits between **good** and **bad**. This uses the same idea as [dichotomic
search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomic_search):
* Pick the middle commit between **good** and **bad**, **middle**
* Run the tests. If they pass, **good** becomes **middle** and repeat. Else, **bad** becomes **middle** and repeat.
* Stop when **bad** is the commit immediately following **good**

If you are testing manually, or tests are slow to run, the gains from $N$ to $\log_2 N$ can add up very quickly, hence
the importance of this feature. Let's start bisecting our repository:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
<span style="color:gray"># git bisect start [good [bad]]</span>
<span style="color:gray"># Additionally, you can mark commits with \`git bisect good\` and \`git bisect bad\`</span>
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white">git bisect start HEAD master~8</span>
Bisecting: 3 revisions left to test after this (roughly 2 steps)
[5889f58fd7ec438b5e45ddab97611f6d34e916de] Update sorting logic
`} />

Git estimates the number of revisions to test to 3, which is already much less than our repository's history (9). In
order to locate the first bad commit, we can then run the automated bisection with `git bisect run`:

<TerminalOutput set:html={`
<span style="color:gray"># git bisect run command</span>
$ <span style="font-weight:bold;color:white">git bisect run make test</span>
running make test
<span style="color:gray;"># Output omitted</span>

<span style="color:red;">Tests failed with 4</span>
make: *** [Makefile:14: test] Error 4

5889f58fd7ec438b5e45ddab97611f6d34e916de is the first bad commit

    Update sorting logic

 src/insertion.cpp | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
bisect run success
`} />

Thus, with only two commands (`start` and `run`), Git identified the first bad commit in our target range, and checked
it out for us to inspect. When we're done inspecting the bad changes, we can return to the state of the repository
before the bisection with `git bisect reset`.

## Bisecting without automated tests

In our little test project, we already had a test harness set up to find the offending commit. However, this may not
always be the case:
* Some complex issues might require setup outside the repository
* The tests for a given bug might have only been added later

In those cases, you can either:
* Write a script to do the testing, preferably outside the repository folder (so it doesn't conflict with Git checking
  out revisions). Then run it using `git bisect run ../script.sh`
* Test manually. After starting the bisection, check if the current state of the repository is good or bad (Git will
  have checked out the next revision for you), and then mark it as **good** with `git bisect good`, or **bad** with `git
  bisect bad`. Git will then advance to the next revision to be tested.

In any case, you will still benefit from the $O(\log_2 N)$ complexity of the bisection.

## Closing thoughts

When submitting an issue to an open-source project, you will usually have to describe properties of the host system, the
exact version being tested, reproduction instructions, etc...

If you are able to, include the result of `git bisect` in your bug report. Pointing to a relevant changes in the
repository's history will greatly help the maintainers diagnose the issue and work on a fix.

# Conclusion

With this tutorial series, we looked at how to maintain a sane Git history as well as your own sanity. Armed with this
knowledge and carefully crafted Git repository histories, you may now use your newly-acquired advanced Git skills like
bisecting to ~~flex on your colleagues~~ solve issues faster in your code.
