I am currently a DevOps and cloud engineer working at [Kaizen
Solutions](https://kaizen-solutions.net/), but this is far from my first
experience with computers!

I actually started programming when I was around 10 years old, and went on to
pursue my passion and turn it into my career. After obtaining my computer
science engineering diploma from [Grenoble INP
Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/) I went on to study computer graphics
and texture synthesis before pivoting to my current position in late 2021.

Note that this is only my professional and academic experience, since I have
many other interests like open-source software, language theory, electronics
and music. I am always learning new skills out of curiosity or as part of my
personal projects, and hope to share those discoveries on here when I have the
time to write about them. Stay tuned!

If you are hiring and reading this, you might be interested in my resume, which
